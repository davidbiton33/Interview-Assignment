# Burned Babies Management System

## Overview

This project is designed to manage data for burned babies in a hospital environment. It utilizes a MEAN stack architecture, leveraging MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js for a comprehensive full-stack solution.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **MongoDB Server**: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system. [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

- **Node.js**: Required to run the server-side code. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- **Angular CLI**: Necessary for the Angular application setup. If you're not sure about having Angular CLI installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` in your terminal. [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

## Setup Instructions

### Server Side

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the `node-server` directory of the project.

   cd node-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required npm packages.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Server**

   Start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Client Side

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory**

   Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory of the project.

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required npm packages.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Serve the Application**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   The application will be available on `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

After setting up both the server and client sides, you can use the application to manage data for burned babies in the hospital. The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
